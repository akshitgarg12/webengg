  <p style="margin-top:-350px;margin-left:380px">A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life.
    It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work,
    relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of
    these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé),
     a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various
     aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience,
    and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.<br><br>
Biographical works are usually non-fiction, but fiction can also be used to
portray a person's life. One in-depth form of biographical coverage is called legacy writing.
Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the genre known as biography.
