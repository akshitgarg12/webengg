      Fiction is the classification for any story or setting that is derived from
       imaginationâ€”in other words, not based strictly on history or fact.
     Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings,
     live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games,
     and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers
      to the narrative forms of literature (see literary fiction), including
      novels, novellas, short stories, and plays. Fiction is occasionally used in
       its narrowest sense to mean simply any "literary narrative".

       A work of fiction is an act of creative imagination, so its total faithfulness
       to the real-world is not typically assumed by its audience. Therefore,
       fiction is not commonly expected to present only characters who are actual
       people or descriptions that are factually accurate.
       Instead, the context of fiction, not adhering precisely to the real world,
       is generally understood as being more open to interpretation.Characters and
   events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely
   separate from the known universe: an independent fictional universe.
